Jennifer Goodell and Alex Zhang

Steps to using github:

1.  Make sure you are in the correct folder!
2.  Add a branch using git checkout -b nameofnewbranch
3.  remote add your branch using git push -u origin nameofnewbranch or by working within that branch and pushing 
changes up directly from there
4.  Make sure the other person is a collaborator!
5.  Fixed conflict using fetch and pull, but still not sure exactly what the 
difference is between the two
 

Right now Jennifer is trying to figure out how to add one of Alex's files
to github without having to merge the whole branch.  

I thought that going into the master branch and using git add on the file 
would work, but it is not.  It says that I don't have permission to fetch 
the files in question, though I can fetch them when I am in that branch.  

I tried copying the document from my branch to the desktop and then moving 
it into the master file after I switched branches, but it does not recognize
the file.  

We have a few good files in Alex and a few good files in Master (because I 
already merged Jennifer), but we don't know how to pick and choose.  


How to merge a single file with master:
	1.  Create a new branch for that file.
		This new branch will contain all elements of master
		You will only apply edits to the file in question
		IF THERE ARE DOCUMENTS THAT CONFLICT WITH MASTER	
			git rm them.  Then ***
	2.  Open that file and the desired version of that file side-by-side
		You may have to switch branches to find the desired file.
	3.  Copy paste the desired version into the branch version
	4.  Make sure you switched back to the newly created branch!
	5.  Add, commit, and push the desired version.  
	5.  Switch to branch Master
	6.  Merge with desired branch 
		This will not affect documents that already agree with master
		***For removed files, you will get a conflict!
			You must git add them back to master
