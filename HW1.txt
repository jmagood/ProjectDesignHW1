Jennifer Goodell and Alex Zhang

Right now Jennifer is trying to figure out how to add one of Alex's files
to github without having to merge the whole branch.  

I thought that going into the master branch and using git add on the file 
would work, but it is not.  It says that I don't have permission to fetch 
the files in question, though I can fetch them when I am in that branch.  

I tried copying the document from my branch to the desktop and then moving 
it into the master file after I switched branches, but it does not recognize
the file.  

We have a few good files in Alex and a few good files in Master (because I 
already merged Jennifer), but we don't know how to pick and choose.
