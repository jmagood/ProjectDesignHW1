In this code we have a few documents.  

One is HW1.
In this we list some of the things we have learned in Github and 
some notes that we want to remember for the future.  

One is a python script, factorial.
Alex wrote the first half of the code
to subtract factorials and Jennifer wrote 
the second half to add factorials. 

One is our TrelloScreenshot.
This is a simple screenshot taken from Jennifer's computer.

Finally, this is the README file.
